# Jumper Wires

Jumper wires are used to connect two terminals and are essential for prototyping  
circuits. While jumper wires come in various types, this explanation focuses on   
those designed for use with breadboards. These wires are commonly used to transfer   
electrical signals between different points on a breadboard and the input/output   
pins of a microcontroller.  

## How They Work

Jumper wires are connected by inserting their “end connectors” into the slots on   
the breadboard. Beneath the breadboard’s surface, parallel metal plates connect the   
slots in grouped rows or columns, depending on the section. The “end connectors”   
are inserted into specific slots to establish connections in the desired prototype,   
all without requiring soldering.   

Types of Jumper Wires Jumper wires come in three main types:   
- Female-to-Female: Both ends have female connectors.   
- Male-to-Male: Both ends have male connectors.   
- Male-to-Female: One end has a male connector (a protruding pin), while   
  the other end has a female connector (a recessed socket).   

These variations make jumper wires versatile and suitable for connecting components with   
different pin configurations.
